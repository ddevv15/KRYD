**User Prompt**

> Implement unified Magic Bento section replacing 'Why Us' and 'Our Services' sections. Use Magic Bento component from reactbits.dev with GSAP animations. Create 2 header cards (Why Us + Our Services) with larger visual span at top, followed by 4 'Why Us' cards and 5 'Services' cards below. Move Who We Are section to second position after Hero. Update navigation: "Overview" → "Who We Are", "Services" → Magic Bento section. Proceed systematically.

**Actions**

- Installed `gsap` dependency (v3.x) for advanced animations.
- Created `components/sections/magic-bento-section.tsx`:
  - Implemented full Magic Bento component with GSAP-powered interactions
  - Added particle effects, global spotlight, border glow, tilt, magnetism, click ripples
  - Configured responsive bento grid layout (1/2/4 columns based on viewport)
- Populated with actual content:
  - 2 header cards: "Why Us" and "Our Services"
  - 4 "Why Us" value proposition cards
  - 5 service offering cards (total 11 cards)
- Restructured `app/page.tsx`:
  - New order: Hero → WhoWeAre → MagicBentoSection → Contact
  - Removed old Overview and Services components
- Updated `components/site-header.tsx`:
  - "Overview" nav link renamed to "Who We Are" (→ #who-we-are)
  - "Services" nav link now points to #overview (Magic Bento section)
  - Applied to both desktop and mobile navigation
- Deleted deprecated component files:
  - `components/sections/overview.tsx`
  - `components/sections/services.tsx`

**Files Changed**

- package.json (UPDATED - added gsap)
- components/sections/magic-bento-section.tsx (NEW)
- app/page.tsx (UPDATED)
- components/site-header.tsx (UPDATED)
- components/sections/overview.tsx (DELETED)
- components/sections/services.tsx (DELETED)
- docs/logs.md (UPDATED)
- docs/activity.md (UPDATED)

**Technical Details**

- Magic Bento features: spotlight tracking, particle animations, 3D tilt, magnetic hover, click ripple effects
- Grid layout: first 2 cards span 2 columns (headers), remaining 9 cards fill naturally
- Performance: reduced particle count to 8, disabled animations on mobile
- Section ID: `#overview` for backward compatibility with existing navigation

**Outcome**

- Unified, interactive "Why Us + Services" section with dynamic GSAP animations
- Improved visual hierarchy with prominent header cards
- Cleaner codebase with consolidated logic in single reusable component
