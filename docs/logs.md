**User Prompt**

> when I try running the project, it returns 404, hence there is some error, in it, try running from your end, once

**Action Taken**

- Started dev server locally to reproduce. Observed that `basePath: '/KRYD'` and `assetPrefix: '/KRYD/'` in `next.config.mjs` cause the app to be served at `/KRYD` during development.

## 2025-10-08 — LOG-0024

**User Prompt**

> Implement a new unified Magic Bento section for a Next.js + TailwindCSS website. Replace the separate 'Why Us' and 'Our Services' sections with a single, cohesive, animated 'Magic Bento' grid using the MagicBento component from reactbits.dev. Use an array of objects to define the cards (title, description, category, and optional icon). The top two (Why Us + Our Services) should have a larger visual span. Maintain consistent spacing and smooth animation transitions. Ensure full responsiveness: 1-column layout on mobile, multi-column grid on desktop. Do not start working yet, will provide the source code for the component. Discuss implementation strategy first.

**Action Taken**

- Analyzed current structure (overview.tsx and services.tsx as separate sections).
- Proposed creating new unified component `components/sections/magic-bento-section.tsx` rather than merging into existing file.
- Outlined clean implementation workflow: create new file → update page.tsx → remove old imports → archive old files.
- Captured questions about section positioning, Logo usage, section IDs, and background styling.

**Files Affected**

- None (planning phase)

## 2025-10-08 — LOG-0025

**User Prompt**

> We are moving the who-we-are.tsx upwards as it would be the second section that comes up, after the hero page. Let's wait on the logo part, we can decide it later. For section id, change the overview button on site header to "Who We Are", or you can keep it the same, so change section id for the new magic bento component to either "why us" or "overview" it does not matter. Yes it should maintain the black background. The services button should lead the user to this new merged section. Once you are ready I will provide the source code.

**Action Taken**

- Confirmed page structure: Hero → Who We Are (moved up) → Magic Bento Section (new unified) → Contact.
- Planned navigation changes: "Overview" button → rename to "Who We Are" (links to #who-we-are); "Services" button → links to new Magic Bento section (#overview).
- Defined Magic Bento specs: file `components/sections/magic-bento-section.tsx`, section ID `id="overview"`, background `bg-black`, Logo TBD.
- Outlined files to modify: create magic-bento-section.tsx, update page.tsx (reorder), update site-header.tsx (nav), update docs/activity.md, delete/archive old files.
- Asked clarifying questions about section title/heading and visual hierarchy.

**Files Affected**

- None (planning phase)

## 2025-10-08 — LOG-0026

**User Prompt**

> Should the Magic Bento section have a visible section title/heading, or just dive straight into the bento grid? - no for now lets keep it as diving straight into the bento grid if we feel we can change it later on. Any preference on the visual hierarchy of the two header cards (Why Us vs Our Services)? - no hierarchy as of right now

**Action Taken**

- Confirmed final implementation specs:
  - No section title - straight to bento grid
  - Equal hierarchy for "Why Us" and "Our Services" header cards
  - Section ID: `id="overview"`
  - Background: `bg-black`
  - Navigation: "Overview" → "Who We Are", "Services" → Magic Bento section

**User Prompt**

> Fix card alignment in Magic Bento grid. The service cards and Big Services card were not aligning properly - the last two service cards (Web and App Dev) were not aligned with the bottom of the Big Services card.

**Action Taken**

- Fixed Big Services card grid positioning:
  - Changed from `grid-row: 3 / span 3` to `grid-row: 3 / 6` for explicit row spanning
  - Ensures Big Services card spans exactly rows 3, 4, and 5 to align with 6 service cards in 3×2 layout
- Adjusted grid row heights for consistency:
  - Changed `grid-auto-rows` from `minmax(200px, auto)` to `minmax(220px, 1fr)`

**User Prompt**

> Fix persistent alignment issues in Magic Bento grid. The previous fix didn't work - cards are still not aligned properly. Use explicit grid rows to ensure perfect alignment between service cards and Big Services card.

**Action Taken**

- Replaced `grid-auto-rows` with explicit `grid-template-rows`:
  - Changed from `grid-auto-rows: minmax(220px, 1fr)` to `grid-template-rows: repeat(5, minmax(200px, 1fr))`
  - Explicit row definition ensures all 5 rows have equal height
  - Each row has minimum 200px height and grows equally with available space
- Updated card height constraints:
  - Removed `aspect-[4/3]` ratio constraint
  - Removed `min-h-[200px]` minimum height
  - Changed to `h-full` to fill entire grid cell height
  - Cards now fully occupy their assigned grid areas
- This ensures perfect alignment:
  - Big Why Us (rows 1-2) aligns with 4 Why Us cards (rows 1-2)
  - 6 Service cards (rows 3-5, 2 cards per row) align with Big Services card (rows 3-5)

- Prevents excessive DOM updates and repaints
- Stores last mouse position in ref for RAF callback
- Proper RAF cleanup on component unmount
- Replaced GSAP position updates with direct style manipulation for spotlight (better performance)

**3. GPU Acceleration:**

- Added `will-change: transform, box-shadow` to cards
- Added `transform: translateZ(0)` to trigger GPU layer
- Added `backface-visibility: hidden` to prevent flickering
- Added `will-change` hints to particles, spotlight, and border glows

**4. Event Listener Optimization:**

- Added `{ passive: true }` to mousemove listeners (better scroll performance)
- Added `{ passive: true }` to mouseleave listeners
- Added `{ passive: true }` to resize listeners

**5. Resize Debouncing:**

**User Prompt**

> Fix mobile layout card order. The "Our Services" header card appears last on mobile, but it should come right after the "Why Us" cards, before the individual service cards.

**Action Taken**

- Changed mobile layout from grid to flexbox with `display: flex; flex-direction: column`
- Implemented CSS `order` property to reorder cards on mobile (max-width: 599px):
  - **Big Why Us**: order 0 (first)
  - **Why Us value cards** (4 cards): order 1-4
  - **Big Services**: order 5 (moved up from position 12)
  - **Service cards** (6 cards): order 6-11 (after Big Services)
- Desktop grid layout unchanged (maintains perfect alignment)
- Mobile now shows logical flow: header → values → header → services

**Mobile Card Order (Before):**

1. Big Why Us
2. Why Us cards (4)
3. Service cards (6)
4. Big Services ❌ (wrong position)

**Mobile Card Order (After):**

1. Big Why Us
2. Why Us cards (4)
3. Big Services ✅ (correct position)
4. Service cards (6)
