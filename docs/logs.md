## 2025-10-06 — LOG-0008

**User Prompt**

> Error: A tree hydrated but some attributes of the server rendered HTML didn't match the client properties... why do we have this hydration error?

**Action Taken**

- Inspected `app/layout.tsx`, `app/page.tsx`, and `hooks/use-mobile.ts` for SSR/client-only divergence.
- Identified mismatch on `<body>` attributes injected by a browser extension (e.g., Grammarly), matching the error diff.
- Provided mitigation steps: disable extensions/incognito to verify; optionally add `suppressHydrationWarning` on `<body>`; avoid client-only dynamic values during SSR.

## 2025-10-06 — LOG-0015

**User Prompt**

> when I try running the project, it returns 404, hence there is some error, in it, try running from your end, once

**Action Taken**

- Started dev server locally to reproduce. Observed that `basePath: '/KRYD'` and `assetPrefix: '/KRYD/'` in `next.config.mjs` cause the app to be served at `/KRYD` during development.
- Guidance: open `http://localhost:3000/KRYD` (not `/`). No code changes made.
- Option (pending approval): make basePath/assetPrefix conditional (production only) to avoid 404 locally.
